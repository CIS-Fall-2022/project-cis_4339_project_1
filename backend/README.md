# Backend

This implementation is for NodeJS based on [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and uses [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) as the ODM.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Before startup 
Setup a .env file with the following variables, e.g.:

```
MONGO_URL = mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.abcdc.mongodb.net/dbname
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm start
```
### API Documentation for all API routes
```
https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/17571565/2s83zfRQvs
```
### Link for Mongo Atlas connection
```
mongodb+srv://TestUser:TestPassword@cluster0.dmsz3xp.mongodb.net/test
```
The Mongo Atlas has data already in it but If you would like to run a local instance, that is also fine.
